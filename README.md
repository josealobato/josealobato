### Hi there 👋

I am an iOS and macOS developer. Now working on iOS for [Teamwork](https://teamwork.com), previously on macOS for [DxO](https://www.dxo.com/dxo-photolab/) and 10 years on Embeeded Software at Lear Coorporation (https://www.lear.com/technology). I love Software Engineering, [Swift](https://swift.org), [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), [Python](https://www.python.org), and [Vim](https://www.vim.org). I am also a believer in [Agile Software Development](http://agilemanifesto.org).

I also run 🏃‍♂️ play guitar and read a lot.

🌱 I’m currently learning French and playing the piano.
